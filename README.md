For the purpose of this project, I've strctured the this document based on an assumption of the following cycle:
  1. Find a job opening that meets basic requirements for holding yoru interest.
  2. Apply to apply to the aforementioned job, or batch your applications after another round of job poisting / company evaluation / disqualification.
  3. Interview for the job.
  4. Meet or exceed the performance requirementf of the job over an extended period of timee. 
  5. Get promoted, bored/frustrated, fired, or quit job.
  6. Lather, rinse, repeat.
